# go.sum
# This file contains checksums for Go module dependencies
# Since this basic application has no external dependencies,
# this file is empty or can be omitted.
#
# When you add dependencies using 'go get', this file will be
# automatically populated with checksums for those dependencies.
#
# Example entries would look like:
# github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.1 h1:4idEAncQnU5cB7BeOkPtxjfCSye0AAm1R0RVIqJ+Jmg=
# github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.1/go.mod h1:hPrL7YrpYKXt5YId3A/Tnip5kqbEAP+KLuI3SUcPTeU=
